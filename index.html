		<p>I was born in Texas, and grew up with the best BBQ in the world.  Totally irrelavant to the conversation at hand, but I seem to include it every time I speak of Texas.  When it comes to design, good design is always instantly recognizable, and so is bad design.  Working in the sign industry, we got to do some really cool things, and we made our share of bad ideas come to life, because the customer was paying for it.  It made me appreciate clean simple design all the more.</p>
